            year: 2022,
            abstract: "This research focused on using raw banana powder to create ice cream sticks. Experimenting with different proportions, they found that 50-80% banana powder with 40% sugar and 40 min baking resulted in a product with properties similar to wooden sticks, good appearance, and positive consumer response. Shelf life was 8 days.",
